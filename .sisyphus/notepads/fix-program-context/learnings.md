- Standardized all TUI views to use ProgramContext for shared state (Config, Store, Dimensions).
- Updated LogsModel and SettingsModel constructors and structs.
- Fixed build errors in model.go by ensuring ProgramContext is passed to all view constructors.
- Updated all related tests (logs_test.go, settings_test.go, resize_test.go) to use the new constructor signatures.
